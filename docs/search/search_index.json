If you are using your phone, it shouldn't take more than 20-30 minutes though.</p> <p>In case you're curious, here's an example of the entire flow: </p> <ul> <li>In the iOS app, you subscribe to <code>https://ntfy.example.com/mytopic</code></li> <li>The app subscribes to the Firebase topic <code>6de73be8dfb7d69e...</code> (the SHA256 of the topic URL)</li> <li>When you publish a message to <code>https://ntfy.example.com/mytopic</code>, your ntfy server will publish a    poll request to <code>https://ntfy.sh/6de73be8dfb7d69e...</code>.

Some options (<code>log-level</code> and <code>log-level-overrides</code>) can be hot reloaded by calling <code>kill -HUP $pid</code> or <code>systemctl reload ntfy</code>.</p> <p>The following config options define the logging behavior:</p> <ul> <li><code>log-format</code> defines the output format, can be <code>text</code> (default) or <code>json</code></li> <li><code>log-file</code> is a filename to write logs to. If this is not set, ntfy logs to stderr.</li> <li><code>log-level</code> defines the default log level, can be one of <code>trace</code>, <code>debug</code>, <code>info</code> (default), <code>warn</code> or <code>error</code>.   Be aware that <code>debug</code> (and particularly <code>trace</code>) can be very verbose. Only turn them on briefly for debugging purposes.</li> <li><code>log-level-overrides</code> lets you override the log level if certain fields match. This is incredibly powerful   for debugging certain parts of the system (e.g. only the account management, or only a certain visitor).   This is an array of strings in the format:<ul> <li><code>field=value -&gt; level</code> to match a value exactly, e.g. <code>tag=manager -&gt; trace</code></li> <li><code>field -&gt; level</code> to match any value, e.g. <code>time_taken_ms -&gt; debug</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Logging config (good for production use): <pre><code>log-level: info\nlog-format: json\nlog-file: /var/log/ntfy.log\n</code></pre></p> <p>Temporary debugging:  If something's not working right, you can debug/trace through what the ntfy server is doing by setting the <code>log-level</code> to <code>debug</code> or <code>trace</code>. The <code>debug</code> setting will output information about each published message, but not the message contents. The <code>trace</code> setting will also print the message contents.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can set <code>log-level-overrides</code> for only certain fields, such as a visitor's IP address (<code>visitor_ip</code>),  a username (<code>user_name</code>), or a tag (<code>tag</code>). There are dozens of fields you can use to override log levels. To learn what  they are, either turn the log-level to <code>trace</code> and observe, or reference the source code.</p> <p>Here's an example that will output only <code>info</code> log events, except when they match either of the defined overrides: <pre><code>log-level: info\nlog-level-overrides:\n- \"tag=manager -&gt; trace\"\n- \"visitor_ip=1.2.3.4 -&gt; debug\"\n- \"time_taken_ms -&gt; debug\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Warning</p> <p>The <code>debug</code> and <code>trace</code> log levels are very verbose, and using <code>log-level-overrides</code> has a  performance penalty. Only use it for temporary debugging.</p> <p>You can also hot-reload the <code>log-level</code> and <code>log-level-overrides</code> by sending the <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to the process after  editing the <code>server.yml</code> file. You can do so by calling <code>systemctl reload ntfy</code> (if ntfy is running inside systemd),  or by calling <code>kill -HUP $(pidof ntfy)</code>.

So far, this is implemented only in the web app only. Once it's in the Android/iOS   app, you can easily keep your account in sync. Relevant config options are <code>enable-signup</code> and    <code>enable-login</code>.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Topic reservations \ud83c\udf89: If enabled, users can now reserve topics and restrict access to other users.   Once this is fully rolled out, you may reserve <code>ntfy.sh/philbackups</code> and define access so that only you can publish/subscribe   to the topic. Reservations let you claim ownership of a topic, and you can define access permissions for others as   <code>deny-all</code> (only you have full access), <code>read-only</code> (you can publish/subscribe, others can subscribe), <code>write-only</code> (you    can publish/subscribe, others can publish), <code>read-write</code> (everyone can publish/subscribe, but you remain the owner).   Topic reservations can be configured in the web app if <code>enable-reservations</code> is enabled, and    only if the user has a tier that supports reservations.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Access tokens: It is now possible to create user access tokens for a user account. Access tokens are useful   to avoid having to paste your password to various applications or scripts. For instance, you may want to use a    dedicated token to publish from your backup host, and one from your home automation system. Tokens can be configured   in the web app, or via the <code>ntfy token</code> command. See creating tokens,   and publishing using tokens.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Structured logging: I've redone a lot of the logging to make it more structured, and to make it easier to debug and   troubleshoot. Logs can now be written to a file, and as JSON (if configured). Each log event carries context fields   that you can filter and search on using tools like <code>jq</code>. On top of that, you can override the log level if certain fields   match. For instance, you can say <code>user_name=phil -&gt; debug</code> to log everything related to a certain user with debug level.   See logging &amp; debugging.</p> </li> <li>Tiers: You can now define and associate usage tiers to users. Tiers can be used to grant users higher limits, such as   daily message limits, attachment size, or make it possible for users to reserve topics. You could, for instance, have   a tier <code>Standard</code> that allows 500 messages/day, 15 MB attachments and 5 allowed topic reservations, and another   tier <code>Friends &amp; Family</code> with much higher limits. For ntfy.sh, I'll mostly use these tiers to facilitate paid plans (see below).   Tiers can be configured via the <code>ntfy tier ...</code> command. See tiers.</li> <li>Paid tiers: Starting very soon, I will be offering paid tiers for ntfy.sh on top of the free service. You'll be   able to subscribe to tiers with higher rate limits (more daily messages, bigger attachments) and topic reservations.   Paid tiers are facilitated by integrating Stripe as a payment provider. See payments   for details.</li> </ul> <p>ntfy is forever open source!  Yes, I will be offering some paid plans. But you don't need to panic! I won't be taking any features away, and everything  will remain forever open source, so you can self-host if you like. Similar to the donations via GitHub Sponsors and Liberapay, paid plans will help pay for the service and keep me motivated to keep going. It'll only make ntfy better.</p> <p>Other tickets:</p> <ul> <li>User account signup, login, topic reservations, access tokens, tiers etc. (#522)</li> <li><code>OPTIONS</code> method calls are not serviced when the UI is disabled (#598, thanks to @enticedwanderer for reporting)</li> </ul> <p>Special thanks:</p> <p>A big Thank-you goes to everyone who tested the user account and payments work.
