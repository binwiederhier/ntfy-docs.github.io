# [docs.ntfy.sh](https://docs.ntfy.sh)

This repo contains generated HTML output of the [ntfy](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) documentation.
It is triggered via the main repo's [docs.yml](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml) pipeline.

The reason why the docs are served via GitHub pages instead of just via ntfy.sh/docs is to reduce AWS outbound traffic costs.
